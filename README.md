# BlackjackProject

## OVERVIEW
I am happy to announce that after many hours I have completed my Blackjack Project! This one has been an exciting and challenging process for me. As i seem to have bitten off a little more than i can chew. I have added a bank function, which allows the user to input a starting bet, and also bet throughout the game. Which was very tricky to turn into a command-line game.

As tricky as it may have been. I am very glad i decided to push myself a little further by taking on a challenge.

## CONCEPTS
This project greatly reinforced the basics, as I tended to use a lot of functionality from the beginning of my SD course. As well as a large amount of Inheritance. 

* Many conditionals (if statements) were used extensively, to ensure the user with many options.
* With the use of loops, I managed to deepen my understanding of repetitive task that are much needed for programs like this.
* Object Oriented Programming, has yet to fail me. I worked with a variety of classes as well as methods to gain the overall functionality of the app.
